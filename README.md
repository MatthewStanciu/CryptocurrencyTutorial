# CryptocurrencyTutorial
The purpose of this repository is to familiarize people with how the blockchain works and how to build your own cryptocurrency/blockchain
completely from scratch -- that means not on top of the Ethereum blockchain or something similar. This allows anyone who views this
repository to obtain a much deeper understanding of the technology that powers Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. which allows you to be at the
forefront of this rapidly growing industry.

Please note that this is not at all practical. If you really want to make your own cryptocurrency, Ethereum is the way to go unless you
are a computer scientist who has a brilliant idea that improves or expands upon current blockchain technologies. This is only for
educational purposes (also, it's super basic).

I made this as part of my high school club, CAT Club, in preparation for CodeDay Chicago in February, but this repository is public for anyone to stumble upon and learn more about the blockchain.
